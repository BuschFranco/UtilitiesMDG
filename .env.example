# Email Configuration
# SMTP server settings (example for Gmail)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com

# Recipient email (where briefs will be sent)
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the values with your actual email configuration
# 3. For Gmail, you need to:
#    - Enable 2-factor authentication
#    - Generate an App Password (not your regular password)
#    - Use the App Password in SMTP_PASS
# 4. Make sure .env is in your .gitignore file (it should be by default)
